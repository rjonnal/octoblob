    "This document contains instructions for interactively running OCTA processing. It is meant to illustrate the architecture of the processing tool chain, the distinction between the OCT/OCTA libraries and processing scripts, and other important (and confusing) issues. In actuality, the OCTA data will be processed using Python scripts (i.e., batch processing), with no interaction with the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in constructing a script is to import the tools you'll need. ```numpy``` and ```matplotlib``` are the standard numerical and plotting libraries in Python, and are always imported. The ```__future___``` and ```builtins``` imports implement some Python 3 functions, which will make porting this to Python 3 easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```octoblob``` is the unfortunate name I've chosen for the OCT/OCTA processing libraries. It is a descendent of the now obsolete ```octopod``` and ```cuttlefish``` libraries we've used in the past. We could have imported all the classes and functions from octoblob with ```from octoblob import *```, but it's better practice to keep the module name around, so that when module functions are called (e.g. ```bscan = blob.make_bscan(data)```), it's clear that the function is coming from the octoblob package, and clear where one needs to go to find the definition of the function.

    "## Some architectural principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One reasonable way to think about scientific software is to split it into two categories: **libraries** and **scripts**. Libraries are collections of functions (and *classes*--more on that later) where each function and class has a well-defined goal, and the implementations have been extensively tested or otherwise verified to be correct. We *really* don't want any errors in a library. Scripts are the day-to-day programs we run. Some are batch scripts that process lots of data autonomously, and others are exploratory, where we run them to see what the data looks like, often in order to help us design the next step in the processing pipeline. Sometimes a portion of a script becomes used so frequently that it makes sense to turn it into a library functions and thus simplify the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Specifically with regard to the OCT/OCTA processing pipeline, I believe the libraries should be split into two parts: 1) a library for reading raw data and getting it organized, and 2) a library for turning raw data into OCT/OCTA images. The first of these is handled by a *class*, and the second is handled by a set of *functions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classes**. If you're not familiar with object-oriented programming, all you need to know about a class is that it is a specification for an *object*, i.e. a list of functions and variables that are stored together and somehow insulated from the rest of the code. The raw OCT data is handled by a class, because it needs to keep track of lots of information about the data. We create an ```OCTRawData``` class, and it keeps track of how many bytes there are per pixel, how many pixels per spectrum, how many spectra per B-scan, etc. By implementing this with a class, we don't have to specify how to get the raw data every time we need a new frame. We just instantiate the object and then ask it for frames, which will be illustrated below."
